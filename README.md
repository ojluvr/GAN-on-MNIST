# GAN-on-MNIST
This project implements a simple GAN using TensorFlow and Keras to generate handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. A generator creates 28x28 images from random noise, while a discriminator classifies them as real or fake. Both models are trained adversarially, with sample outputs visualized during training.
